# Basics

This directory will contain an installation guide and brief description on each of the sub-directories. I will also define the bottom the end-goals of this path. i.e: By going over this repository you should be familiar with all of the illustrated concepts.

**Cargo** is the package manager for Rust. To verify if **cargo** is installed,

``` shell
cargo -V
cargo 1.63.0 (fd9c4297c 2022-07-01)
```

*Note for the rest of this prepartion kit. I will be using IntelliJ as an IDE (make sure to install the RUST plugin)*
